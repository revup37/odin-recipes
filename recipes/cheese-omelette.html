        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>It's a recipe for cheese omelette. I love it, it's good. It's important that you keep the temperature on the
            low
            side, as you don't want it to turn brown.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>3 large eggs</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon milk, or as needed</li>
            <li>salt and freshly ground white pepper to taste</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
            <li>Â¼ cup shredded Emmentaler cheese</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Whisk eggs in a bowl; add milk and season with salt and white pepper. Whisk until egg mixture is foamy,
                2 to 3
                minutes.</li>

            <li>Melt butter in a small, nonstick skillet over medium-low heat. Pour in egg mixture and swirl the
                skillet, so the
                bottom is evenly covered with egg. Cook until egg starts to set, about 1 minute. Lift edges with a
                spatula and
                tilt the skillet so uncooked egg can flow towards the bottom of the skillet to set. Repeat until no
                visible
                liquid egg remains.</li>

            <li>Carefully flip omelette; cook until warmed through, 30 seconds to 1 minute. Sprinkle Emmentaler cheese
                down the
                middle of omelette; fold in half. Cook until cheese is melted, about 20 seconds. Slide omelette onto a
                plate.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Tips</h2>
        <p>You can use any cheese in this omelette; we just love Emmentaler cheese.</p>
